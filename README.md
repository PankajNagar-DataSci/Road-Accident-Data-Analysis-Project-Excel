# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis-Project---Excel

ðŸ“Š Road Accident Dashboard Insights ðŸš—

I'm excited to share my latest Excel project: an interactive dashboard that provides detailed insights into road accidents.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step overview of the project:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:
   - Gathered raw data from online sources.
   - Cleaned and processed the data, handling missing values and inconsistencies to make it ready for analysis.
   - The original dataset was quite large, so I streamlined it for convenience and relevance to my analysis.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Extracted monthly trends to understand accident patterns over time.
   - Created various graphs, including visualizations of accidents based on different road types.
   - Developed a tree map to represent the data hierarchically and visually.

3. Dashboard Development:
   - Combined all the visualizations and analyses into an interactive dashboard.
   - Designed the dashboard to be user-friendly and insightful, allowing easy exploration of the data.

The project is named "Road Accident Dashboard" and offers valuable insights into road accident patterns and trends.

âœ¨ Key features include:

- ðŸ“Š Monthly trend analysis for understanding accident patterns over time
- ðŸ“Š Graphs depicting accidents by different road types
- ðŸ“Š Tree map visualization for hierarchical data representation
- ðŸ“Š Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for critical metrics
- ðŸ“Š Donut charts offering clear visual summaries
- ðŸ“Š Detailed data analysis uncovering key insights


Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this project. Let's connect to discuss how these insights can help improve road safety and inform better decision-making.
